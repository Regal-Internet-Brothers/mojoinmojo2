This example is based on the ["Screen Grab" example](https://github.com/ImmutableOctet/mojo2_screen_grab-monkey) written previously by [ImmutableOctet](https://www.github.com/ImmutableOctet), intended for use with ***Mojo 2***.

The version supplied here was 'back ported' from Mojo 2 to Mojo 1, but has not been tested with the original/official Mojo implementation. Likewise, MojoInMojo2 support hasn't been thoroughly tested, and may misbehave.

The 'ReadPixels' and 'WritePixels' commands are highly experimental, and may or may not act as expected. Like most of 'regal.mojoinmojo2', use of these features is not currently recommended for stable products.

However, testing is appreciated. If you experience incorrect behavior, please [start an issue](https://github.com/Regal-Internet-Brothers/mojoinmojo2/issues).
